Making A Model
##############

There are two ways to define Geometry information. Either with an input file (geometry file) or using data
tables in the user interface.


.. _nodes-input:

Nodes And Boundry Conditions
============================

Nodes are labeled with index numbers and have coordinates in Room.
Each node has 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) defined in order :math:`u_x, u_y, u_z, \varphi_x, \varphi_y, \varphi_z`
You can set boundary conditions by locking movement in the desired direction.

With Geometry File
-------------------

Nodes entry begins with keyword '*\node'.
To lock a movement in a certain direction use 1 and to keep the movement unlocked use 0.
The following syntax diagram shows the syntax for nodes input.

.. figure:: resources/figures/nodeEntry.png

    Syntax diagram for nodes entry in geometry file

Where dof is defined as:

.. figure:: resources/figures/dof.png

    Syntax diagram for dof in nodes entry in geometry file

**Example**::

    *node
    -1.0,0.0,0.0,1,1,1,1,1,1
    0.0,0.0,-1.0,1,1,1,0,0,0
    1.0,0.0,2.0
    3.0,0.0,-2.0,1,1,1,0,1,1
    4.0,0.0,1.0,1,1,1,1,0,1
    2.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,0
    3.0,0.0,2.0,1,1,1,1,1,1

first node location is (-1,0,0) and has it's all dof directions locked. Second node location is (0,0,-1) and has all
translation dof directions locked.

Notice that the third node has only its coordinates defined. All undefined dof numbers will be substituted
with 0 (unlocked).

With User Interface
--------------------
As in nodes, elements and other input tables
right click on a table row or on an emtpy table to add/remove rows.

Use the checkbox to lock (checked) and
unlock (unchecked) the movement in a certain direction.

Nodes and Boundry Conditions Visualization
------------------------------------------

Nodes are black square points. Orange cones are the boundary conditions (bc) for locking translation in each global direction
in the cartesian coordinate system. Two nested blue cones are bc for locking rotation in each direction.

Elements
========

Elements are, in this current development stage, 3D Beams. Each element has an index number and is defined using starting
and ending node index number. Vector :math:`v` is used to define local z-axis. (for further info about element
orientation see :doc:`theory`)

With Geometry File
-------------------

Elements entry begins with keyword '*ßelement'. A starting and ending node index must be given.
Element orientation is optional input and is defined using vector :math:`\vec{v}`.
If not given default element orientation will be used.
At last optional but necessary profile number should be given.

The following syntax diagram shows the syntax for elements input.

.. figure:: resources/figures/elementEntry.png

    Syntax diagram for element entry in geometry file

**Example**:
from nodes example above we can define following elements::

    *element
    1,2,1,-1,0,0
    2,3,,0,0,1
    3,4,1,-1,0,0

first element is defined with nodes 1 and 2 and has profile 1 and orientation vector (1,-1,0).
Second element has no profile defined and will be excluded from simulation later.

With User Interface
--------------------

Analogous to :ref:`nodes-input`

Elements Visualization

Nodes Loads
===========

Nodes Loads or Point Load describes the force that acts at a point.
Point loads can be only defined using an existing node index number and the following parameters:

:math:`\vec{F}= \left(\begin{array}{c} F_x \\ F_y \\ F_z \end{array}\right)` is Force vector
and
:math:`\vec{M}= \left(\begin{array}{c} M_x \\ M_y \\ M_z \end{array}\right)` is momentum vector on the specified node

With Geometry File
------------------

To define node loads use the keyword '*\load'. Each entry starts with a valid node index number followed by 6
floating-point numbers for force and momentum vector respectively.

The following syntax diagram hopefully clarifies syntax for point load.

.. figure:: resources/figures/loadEntry.png

    Syntax diagram for load entry in geometry files

**Example**:
from nodes example above we can define following loads::

    *load
    2,10000,0,0,0,0,0
    2, 1,1
    1, 1,1,1,1,1,1

Note that loads on node 1 are superposition in the calculation.
The second entry contains only the first two components of the force vector.
In this case, all other components will be assumed to be zero as if '2,1,1,0,0,0,0' where given.

With User Interface
--------------------

Analogous to :ref:`nodes-input`


Nodes Loads Visualization
-------------------------

for :math:`\vec{F}= \left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right)` and
:math:`\vec{M}= \left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{array}\right)`

we get the following:

.. image:: resources/figures/vis_loads.png


Element Loads
=============

Element load or distributed load is understood to be a load that is distributed across a connecting element.
In Beamon such loads are constantly distributed across elements.
Element loads can be only defined using an existing element index number and the following four parameters:
* :math:`q_x` force in local x-axis direction
* :math:`q_y` force in local y-axis direction
* :math:`q_z` force in local z-axis direction
* :math:`q_w` momentum in local x-axis direction

With Geometry File
------------------

To define element loads use the keyword '*\lineload'. Each entry starts with a valid node index number followed by 6
floating-point numbers for force and momentum vector respectively.

The following syntax diagram describes element load entries.

.. figure:: resources/figures/lineloadEntry.png

**Example**::

    *lineload
    2,0,1,-7.5e+07,0
    1,1,0,0,0
    3,0,0,0,1

first element load entry has constant :math:`q_z=-7.5e+06` value on element 2.

Profiles and BeamSize
=====================

Simulating 3D Beams requires specific element properties (profiles). Each profile must contain following parameters:

* :math:`E`: modulus of elasticity E
* :math:`G`: shear modulus
* :math:`A`: cross section area
* :math:`Iy`: moment of inertia with respect to the local y-axis
* :math:`Iz`: moment of inertia with respect to the local z-axis
* :math:`Kv`: St Venant torsional stiffness
* :math:`K`: optional spring stiffness (excluded from simulation momentarily)

**Note**: It is assumed that :math:`I_{yz}` is zero.

With Geometry File
------------------

To define profiles use keyword '\*profile'.
The following syntax diagram shows how each profile entry should be.

**Example**::

    *profile
    7e+10,3e+10,0.25,0.00520833,0.00520833,0.00880208,0

With User Interface
--------------------

Analogous to :ref:`nodes-input`

With BeamSize
-------------

Calculating profile values could be tricky, especially if you are dealing with complex profiles.
**BeamSize** should simplify calculating profile values depending on which geometry you use.

It is worth noting that in the current development only profiles with :math:`I_{yz}=0` yield correct simulation results.

Steps to calculate profiles:

1. Choose geometry type (one of the tabs)
2. Enter profile dimensions in "Dimensions" section or just click and drag one of the handles in the drawing on the right side
3. Results in "Output" section can be saved by clicking "save" button
4. Save results in your project by entering modulus of elasticity and shear modulus.
5. Calculated and entered values can be seen in profiles table in the visualizer.
