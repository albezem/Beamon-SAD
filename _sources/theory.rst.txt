This project is base on bachelor thesis "Entwicklung eines Softwaresystems zur Visualisierung und Simulation von
Tragwerksstrukturen" in english "Development of a software system for the visualization and simulation of truss
structures" at institute of structural mechanics and lightweight design at RWTH-Aachen University.

Element Orientation
====================

Supposedly we have an element defined between points A and B.
We define elements local z-axis by an auxiliary vector :math:`\vec{v}`. As shown in Figure below, :math:`\vec{v}` has one
orthogonal projection on the normal plane E. The normal vector of E points in the direction
of local x-axis. This projection of :math:`\vec{v}` onto plane E points in the direction of the local z-axis.

    The rotation of an element is based only on the local z-axis, which is defined by the vector :math:`\vec{v}`



CALFEM
======

Beamon's simulation is based on open source library CALFEM. For further information read
