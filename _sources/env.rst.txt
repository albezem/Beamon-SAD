Programming Environment
***********************

Making your environment optimized to deal with large projects such as Beamon is necessary to ensure low-cost
maintenance.

Python Environment
==================

Windows users should install the Anaconda environment.

.. note::

    All packages should be installed via pip and not from conda.

Some anaconda packages are not up to date with the latest releases and will cause compatibility problems.
Nevertheless using Anaconda has proven to be most efficient.

Please Install Anaconda from the `official website <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_

IDE
===

The most convenient IDE for projects like Beamon is PyCharm, especially PyCharm Professional.

Please Install PyCharm from the `official website <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_

Project Requirements
=====================

"Package requirements" are the **absolute minimum** of python packages that are required to perform **all**
operation in the project.

All required packages are in *requirements.txt* file and can be installed via pip using the command::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or using the command::

    make install_requirements

on your environment console.

For windows users, **pywin32**, which will be used to build Windows executables, will be required in addition
to *requirements.txt* packages.

.. warning::

    Package requirements should be updated regularly to guarantee that latest package releases work.
